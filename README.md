# Supermarked explorer

> KÃ¸benhavn edition

This is a short demo of streamlit that visualises shop data from openstreetmap
on a 3D map using pydeck (built into streamlit).

Look at the source code to see how it's made. It's quite simple.

- [commercial_explorer.py](./commercial_explorer.py)
- [supermarked_explorer.py](./supermarked_explorer.py)

```bash
pip install streamlit numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
